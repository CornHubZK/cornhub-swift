# CornHub Swift repo

This is the Swift code we used as base in the iOS app to generate the proof with Noir using Swoir and communicate with the server to update the status of the proof request and send back the proof once it is generated on the mobile app. The logic is the same except here the data is fixed while in the app it is based on the actual passport data.
